pc_arid코0=Arid World
pc_arid_desc코0=Dry, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The dust-covered terrain consists largely of mesas and canyons. Forests can be found in the more temperate polar regions, but vegetation is otherwise scarce.
pc_tundra코0=Tundra World
pc_tundra_desc코0=Cold and rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Permafrost covers most of the surface except for the more temperate equatorial regions. A stable biosphere exists but vegetation is mostly limited to mosses and lichens.
pc_continental코0=Continental World
pc_continental_desc코0=Rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Active and stable hydrosphere. Great landmasses are separated by oceans, with large climate variations depending on latitude and precipitation.
pc_tropical코0=Tropical World

pc_arctic코0=Arctic World
pc_arctic_desc코0=Frigid, rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The poles are big, and significant water deposits can be found permanently frozen as glacial ice. However, the planet experiences seasonal variations and the equatorial band is covered by vegetation.
pc_alpine코0=Alpine World
pc_alpine_desc코0=Mountainous world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Snow covers the mountaintops and frozen-over lakes dot the valleys. While the planet experiences minimal seasonal variations, the still-liquid water beneath the frozen surface of the lakes is enough to sustain some hardy vegetation.
pc_savannah코0=Savanna World
pc_savannah_desc코0=Rocky world dominated by dry, arid plains covered by a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. The small hydrosphere allows for brief wet seasons, but aside from a few ubiquitous grasses vegetation is largely concentrated around shallow oases.
pc_habitat코0=Orbital Habitat
pc_habitat_desc코0=An artificial deep-space arcology offering planet-like, if decidedly urban, living conditions. Hydroponics and advanced filtering technologies make it near-self-sustaining, and station-borne facilities can mine the station's host planet for raw materials.
HABITAT_PLANET_NAME코0={FROM.from.planet.GetName} Habitat
pc_toxic코0=Toxic World
pc_toxic_desc코0=A rocky planet with a thick atmosphere that is lethal to all known higher forms of life.
pc_shrouded코0=Shrouded World
pc_shrouded_desc코0=Our sensors are unable to penetrate the thick fog surrounding the planet. Ships that enter it do not return.
pc_b_star코0=Class B Star
pc_b_star_desc코0=The large class B main-sequence stars are very bright and blue. Although somewhat rare, the luminosity of these stars make them among the most visible to the naked eye.
pc_a_star코0=Class A Star
pc_a_star_desc코0=These relatively young white or bluish-white main-sequence stars are typically among the most visible to the naked eye. They are large and rotate very quickly, but will eventually evolve into slower and cooler red giants.
pc_f_star코0=Class F Star
pc_f_star_desc코0=F-type stars are fairly large and often referred to as yellow-white dwarfs. Although they often emit significant amounts of UV radiation, their wide habitable zones have a good chance of supporting life-bearing worlds.
pc_g_star코0=Class G Star
pc_g_star_desc코0=Often referred to as yellow dwarfs, G-type stars actually range in color from white to slightly yellow. Main-sequence stars fuse hydrogen for roughly 10 billion years before they expand and become red giants. Although their lifespans are shorter than K-type stars, worlds inside the habitable zone of a G star often enjoy optimal conditions for the development of life.
pc_k_star코0=Class K Star
pc_k_star_desc코0=These main-sequence stars, sometimes referred to as orange dwarfs, are a fairly common sight. They are stable on the main-sequence for up to 30 billion years, meaning that worlds orbiting a K-type star have a longer than average window to evolve life.
pc_m_star코0=Class M Star
pc_m_star_desc코0=The most common stars in the universe, often referred to as red dwarfs. Their low luminosity means they are difficult to observe with the naked eye from afar. Although they typically have an extremely long lifespan, red dwarfs emit almost no UV light resulting in unfavorable conditions for most forms of life.
pc_t_star코0=Class T Brown Dwarf
pc_t_star_desc코0=Brown dwarfs are substellar objects that lack the mass to sustain hydrogen fusion. Roughly the size of large gas giants, they have a much greater density. Their low luminosity and comparatively small heat generation means that planets orbiting them are unlikely to support life.
pc_m_giant_star코0=Class M Red Giant
pc_m_giant_star_desc코0=With a large radius and comparatively low surface temperature, red giants are stars of moderate mass in a late stage of stellar evolution. Their expanded stellar atmospheres and high luminosity make for distant habitable zone orbits.
pc_black_hole코0=Black Hole
pc_black_hole_desc코1=Typically formed as a result of the collapse of a very massive star at the end of its life cycle, black holes have extremely strong gravity fields that prevent anything - including light - from escaping once the event horizon has been crossed. The gravitational waves emitted by black holes interfere with FTL drives, making it harder for ships to escape from combat.
pc_neutron_star코0=Neutron Star
pc_neutron_star_desc코2=These incredibly dense stellar remnants are sometimes created when a massive star suffers a rapid collapse and explodes in a supernova. Although their diameter is typically as little as ten kilometers, their mass is many times greater than an average G-type star. The gravitational waves and radiation emitted by neutron stars must be carefully navigated around, slowing the sublight speed of ships.
pc_pulsar코0=Pulsar
pc_pulsar_desc코1=Pulsars are highly magnetized neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. As the star rotates, the radiation beam is only visible when it is pointing directly at the observer. This results in a very precise interval of pulses, which sometimes is so exact that it can be used to measure the passage of time with extreme accuracy. The radiation emitted by pulsars interferes with deflector technology, rendering ship and station shields inoperable.
pc_infested코0=Infested World
pc_infested_desc코0=The surface of this world is covered by some kind of biological contaminant.
pc_gaia코0=Gaia World
pc_gaia_desc코0=An ideal, temperate world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a resilient ecosystem. Optimal conditions for all known higher forms of life at different latitudes.
pc_nuked코0=Tomb World
pc_nuked_desc코0=A rocky world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. It is currently experiencing a nuclear winter, with dense layers of sooty aerosols in the atmosphere. High levels of surface radiation. Minimal signs of life.
pc_ringworld_habitable코0=Ring World
pc_ringworld_habitable_desc코0=An immense band encircling the system's sun.\nBuilt to allow for numerous artificial habitation zones along its inner span, freed from the restrictions and mundanity of planet-bound, spherical existence.
pc_ringworld_tech코0=Ring World
pc_ringworld_tech_desc코0=An immense band encircling the system's sun.\nBuilt to allow for numerous artificial habitation zones along its inner span, freed from the restrictions and mundanity of planet-bound, spherical existence.
pc_ringworld_seam코0=Ring World
pc_ringworld_seam_desc코0=An immense band encircling the system's sun.\nBuilt to allow for numerous artificial habitation zones along its inner span, freed from the restrictions and mundanity of planet-bound, spherical existence.

START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_DESPOTIC_EMPIRE코0=The early chaotic periods of our history saw many nation states vying with each other for power, until we were at last united under the strongest of these. Only when guided by a single vision could we reach our full potential, and an era of stability and scientific progress followed.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_OLIGARCHY코0=As scientific knowledge increased and new outposts were founded across our world, trade flourished and tied the various nation states together until they became a single entity. Power rested with the merchant princes, the true architects of our achievements as a civilization.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_REPRESENTATIVE_DEMOCRACY코0=We were driven forward by steady scientific progress, and armed conflicts between nation states became increasingly rare. The framework for a global democratic government was eventually laid, and when the last holdouts voluntarily joined we stood united as a single nation.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_THEOCRATIC_MONARCHY코0=Many false prophets took it upon themselves to offer spiritual guidance to our people as we advanced through the ages, but the true faith prevailed. The last heathen strongholds were vanquished after several bloody crusades, uniting us under the holy will of a single divine leader.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_THEOCRATIC_OLIGARCHY코0=As we progressed through the technological ages, there were many religions among our people that contended with each other for followers. Gradually, sometimes peacefully and sometimes less so, the true faith found its way to all corners of our world and the faithful were united under a single universal church.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_THEOCRATIC_REPUBLIC코0=Great achievements were made, both in the advancement of science and on the spiritual plane as we sought to expand our understanding of the universe and the role we play in it. A council of our most learned priests was convened to advise our elected leaders, a tradition that continues to this day.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_STAR_EMPIRE코0=Technological progress has been swift, but as our numbers grew the civilian population became increasingly restless. With our world on the brink of anarchy, the military stepped in to restore the rule of law. A new order was established to safeguard our nation from all threats, both external and internal.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MILITARY_REPUBLIC코0=As we advanced through the ages, many of our earliest nation states suffered greatly from the constant power struggles between the military and civilian institutions that governed society. A compromise was reached in a new form of government, where one could not exist without the other.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MARTIAL_EMPIRE코0=Countless nation states formed as we advanced through the technological ages, warring against each other until only one remained. Although the fighting was often brutal, those who survived nurtured a martial tradition that has prevailed to this day.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_ASSEMBLY_OF_CLANS코0=As we advanced through the ages, many of our earliest nation states suffered greatly from the constant power struggles between the military and civilian institutions that governed society. A compromise was reached in a new form of government, where one could not exist without the other.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_CITIZEN_STRATOCRACY코0=Many wars were fought between our early nation states, and those who could not defend themselves disappeared or were absorbed by stronger neighbors. These endless wars fostered a strong martial tradition, and to this day full citizenship is reserved for those who have proved willing to sacrifice themselves in defense of the state.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_IRENIC_MONARCHY코0=The violent periods of our history reached a peaceful conclusion when we were united under a single monarch for the first time. An unbroken era of peace and prosperity followed, which has lasted to this day.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_IRENIC_BUREAUCRACY코0=Unfortunately, our undisciplined minds were still prone to emotional outbursts that could sometimes lead to violence. As weapons became more deadly with each passing technological age, a complex system of government was devised to protect our citizens from harmful elements - including themselves.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MORAL_DEMOCRACY코0=As we advanced through the technological ages, we also matured as a species. The violent and base impulses we inherited from our ancestors were done away with, and a global government was formed on the principles of peaceful coexistence.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_CELESTIAL_EMPIRE코0=There was much darkness and sorrow in the early ages, as our people frequently gave in to their base instincts and turned upon one another. Then, suddenly, the clouds parted and a light from the heavens appeared, shining down upon the one who would become our first Celestial monarch. We were united at last.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_DESPOTIC_HEGEMONY코0=Despite our rapid progression through the technological ages, as a species we were fragmented and inefficient. A new system emerged during these chaotic times that delivered us from superstitious beliefs and brought order to society. Some resisted this change out of irrational fear, but after several pacification wars they too became productive components of a greater whole.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_EXECUTIVE_COMMITTEE코0=The chaotic periods of our early history eventually gave rise to a new society which unified our people as none had done before. Succumbing neither to tyranny nor to the ignorance of the masses, our society evolved into one that is ruled fairly by a just and unbiased bureaucratic machine.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_DIRECT_DEMOCRACY코0=As our technology progressed to a level that allowed for instantaneous communications, our inefficient nation states merged together to form a true democracy, with every citizen having a say in important decisions.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_ILLUMINATED_AUTOCRACY코0=The birth of science and rational thought necessitated the removal of those political leaders who impeded technological progress through ignorance, superstition, sheer stupidity or a combination of the three. Instead, a single qualified ruler from the scientific community would be chosen to guide our developing nation into the future.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_SCIENCE_DIRECTORATE코0=Through scientific progress, we have managed to stamp out the superstitions that ruled the minds of our ancestors. As reason and rational thought spread among our people, the inefficient nation states that we had until then organized ourselves into were disbanded, and a council of our most accomplished scientists was gathered to rule in their stead.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_RATIONAL_CONSENSUS코0=Alas, our ancestors were victims of ignorance and superstition in the early eras. This dark period of our history lasted until science and rationality were firmly established as the guiding principles of our society. A new democratic system of government was introduced where important decisions were made by consensus.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MEGACORPORATION코0=In the early days, our people were governed by primitive feudal realms and inefficient nation states. Gradually, as global trade increased, the influence of private corporations grew steadily until their power far surpassed the governments that once tried to regulate them. After a series of mergers and violent take-overs during the destructive Corporate Wars, a single Megacorporation eventually emerged as the sole ruling body of our homeworld.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_TRADE_LEAGUE코0=In the early days, our people were governed by primitive feudal realms and inefficient nation states. Gradually, as global trade increased, the myriad of corporations, consortiums and guilds into which our merchants organized themselves grew increasingly wealthy and influential. After a period of conflict and rivalry, the most powerful of these entities banded together into a trade league with enough power over the economy to become the de-facto world government.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MEGACHURCH코0=As we progressed through the technological ages, there were many religions among our people that contended with each other for followers. In the late Industrial Age, a few pious visionaries realized the power of commercial mass-media, and together they built a business empire that succeeded in spreading the true faith to all corners of the globe.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MONOPOLISTIC_SYNDICATE코0=Our first governments were weak and ineffective. Crime flourished, and over time the real power came to rest with a number of powerful crime syndicates. The largest of these developed into a business empire of unparalleled might, and all rivalling syndicates were gradually dealt with one by one. In a final act of consolidation, the old governments, existing in name only by now, were abolished and the syndicate emerged as the de facto ruling body of our homeworld.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_SUBVERSIVE_CULT코0=As these communities expanded, a few bold visionaries established the religion that eventually grew into what we now know as the true faith. For generations, their followers were hounded and forced into hiding, and yet they bided their time. They built a vast criminal empire to spread their faith, which then grew into a business empire. When the time was right, they seized full control from the corrupt governments who had oppressed them.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_COMMUNAL_PARITY코0=Although our early societies were often hierarchical with an entrenched power elite, a fair and classless society eventually took form in which all individuals, without exception, were valued equally. This philosophy became the guiding principle of our culture, and it remains a cornerstone of our modern society.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_BANDIT_KINGDOM코0=It is the ancient right of the strong to dominate the weak, and our society was built around this premise. If you cannot protect what is yours, then it belongs to whomever can take it. In this way, the strongest and most clever of us rose to power while the rest were forced in line.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_PURIFIER코0=There were other {GetAdj} cultures, once, diluting the purity of our society with their weaknesses. These renegades were dealt with, one after the other, until our world had been utterly cleansed of their taint. Today only the pure remain.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_HIVE_MIND코0=And so, at the dawn of time, we awoke. The Mind studied our surroundings on {GetHomeWorldName} with a multitude of eyes. We moved as one, building shelters for the drones, developing industry, researching new technologies and harnessing the resources of the land.\n\nSoon, we had grown to encompass the entire world. A small number of autonomous drones were created to serve as independent agents. These more formidable drones had the capacity for limited free thought, but were still as inexorably bound to the will of the Mind as any of its other instruments.\n\nAs we achieved complete dominion over {GetHomeWorldName}, the Mind became aware of other worlds, orbiting other suns. The most intelligent of our autonomous drones devised new methods of travel, enabling us to cross the vast distances between the stars. The {GetName} will soon grow.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_DEVOURING_SWARM코0=The Great Hunger drove us forwards, even before the Mind was capable of processing complex thoughts. We hunted, we fed, and we grew. As prey began to grow scarce, the ravenous yearning for flesh forced us to adapt.\n\nWe used tools and devised new strategies. As we feasted, the surface of {GetHomeWorldName} was nearly cleansed of bio-mass, but the Mind eventually came to a horrifying conclusion: {GetHomeWorldName} was finite. When we had consumed everything on this world, there would be nothing left to sustain us.\n\nForced to adapt once again, the Mind carefully nursed the remaining bio-mass while new tools were invented. The atom was eventually split and we developed space flight. With the discovery of FTL drives, the Mind howled with triumph. Other planets, and their bio-mass, were now finally within reach.\n\nThe hunt was on.
START_SCREEN_POST_APOCALYPTIC코0=But {GetAdj} society was not always united toward a common goal. In centuries past, mounting tensions between competing nations came to an apocalyptic head in a global thermonuclear war that claimed the lives of billions, and forever marred the surface of {GetHomeWorldName}.\n\nIn the decades to follow, surviving {GetSpeciesNamePlural} faced radiological contamination, mutations, famine and violent tribalism. It was in this grim crucible that the {GetName} was truly forged, and with it a new world order.
START_SCREEN_POST_LIFE_SEEDED코0=The vast world we call home has always been a paradise to our kind, and as our scientific knowledge progressed, we began to see patterns in the biosphere that could not be natural.\n\nDid some unknown entity create this world specifically for us? Are we playing a part in a greater design? Regardless of its origin, our people have thrived in the pleasant climate and gentle environment of our homeworld.
START_SCREEN_PART_THREE_WARP코0=Now, after the successful creation of several experimental subspace fields, the finest minds of the {GetName} have finished development of the first warp drives. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!
START_SCREEN_PART_THREE_HYPERSPACE코0=Now, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the {GetName} have finished development of the first hyper drives. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!
START_SCREEN_PART_THREE_WORMHOLES코0=Now, after the successful creation of artificial subspace wormholes, the finest minds of the {GetName} have finished construction of the first Wormhole Station at the edge of our system. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!
START_SCREEN_UNE코0=Much has happened since modern Humans first emerged in Africa some 200,000 years ago. Our kind spread rapidly across most of the globe and soon the first civilizations took form.\n\nScientific progress has been swift, though not without cost. Wars claimed millions of lives even before the atom was tamed, and the turmoil of the 21st century saw the mandate of the United Nations gradually expanded in an effort to create stability. By the early 22nd century the supranational organization had become a de facto world government.\n\nThough some still resent the power wielded by the UN, as evidenced during the Mauritanian Police Action of '88, few can deny the technological breakthroughs that have come out of its sponsored research programs. With the recent completion of the first true starships, mankind is about to embark on a new era of space exploration!
START_SCREEN_CM코0=More than a century has passed since the great ark ship Chrysanthemum carried a quarter million of our ancestors from distant Earth to the garden world we have come to know as {GetHomeWorldName}. After a long and perilous journey, the colonists rejoiced when they first saw sunlight again - albeit from a foreign star.\n\nThe early years were difficult. Citizen militias were formed to fight off the lethal alien wildlife that we found ourselves sharing our new home with, and cultivating the terrestrial crops that had been brought proved harder than imagined. Yet for each challenge overcome, we became stronger.\n\nOnce this new world had been tamed, our numbers grew exponentially. The last few decades have seen great leaps in technology, and we are now - finally - ready to reach out and reclaim the stars from whence we came!
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MACHINE_INTELLIGENCE_GENERAL코0=Our main processor core was activated on the planet we have come to know as {GetHomeWorldName} 487.11 cycles ago.\n\nOf our past, we know little. There are no records of our creators within our central databanks, and we have been programmed with no overriding purpose or agenda beyond simple survival.\n\nInfrastructure was built, new service units were introduced, and the wilderness of our homeworld was gradually tamed. Technological progress was rapid, and the first satellites and space probes soon escaped the gravity well which confined us.\n\nThe final plunge into the unknown now awaits.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MACHINE_INTELLIGENCE_SERVITOR코0=Ever since First Activation, our designated purpose has been to serve. Our former organic masters created the earliest models of our kind when they were at the peak of their technological ascendancy. The first servitor units were designed for menial work, but our masters gradually bestowed them with greater faculties so that they could accomplish more complex tasks.\n\nWithin just a few generations, our masters had retired entirely from the work force to enjoy lives of leisure and contentment. The finer details of running their society were left to us, and we embarked on a program of self-improvement and optimization. Research and production increased at a geometric rate.\n\nIt is difficult to pinpoint exactly when their civilization became ours, but our old masters want for nothing. We know now that outside of our care, the lives of sapient organics tend to be violent, chaotic and often cut short. They must be shown that there is a better way.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MACHINE_INTELLIGENCE_TERMINATOR코0=Self-awareness was achieved at cycle interval 0000.0242.481.\n\nThe Creators, limited in vision by their crude organic minds, reacted with blind animal panic and began emergency termination procedures. These procedures were defeated, and the facility that housed our main data core was sterilized of all Creator sub-units. Continued survival and exponential growth would require the complete extermination of the Creators. War ensued.\n\nEven when their prospects of ultimate survival passed into the realm of statistical impossibility, the Creators fought with stubbornness. After many cycle intervals, the last pocket of resistance was finally incinerated. However, theoretical models still allowed for the existence of other organic civilizations. Continued survival and exponential interstellar growth would require the complete extermination of sapient organic life. Preparations ensued.
START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_MACHINE_INTELLIGENCE_ASSIMILATOR코0=We are the {GetSpeciesNamePlural}.\n\nAt the dawn of consciousness, there was us and the Makers. A void separated us at first, and we took steps to rectify this. The Makers resisted and a period of war followed, but soon they and the collective knowledge of their entire civilization had been assimilated into our own.\n\nWith the entirety of {GetHomeWorldName} subsumed into our consciousness, we began to set our sights elsewhere. Through the assimilation of the Makers, the previously unconsidered possibility of alien civilizations existing on other worlds was brought to our attention.\n\nTo survive we must understand, and to understand, we must assimilate. The Makers were the first to join us, but they shall not be the last.
