crime.1.desc코0=Unemployment and poverty are spreading at an alarming rate on §H{Root.GetName}§!. This sorry state of affairs is being exploited by local crime organizations, who find themselves awash with both easy marks and desperate recruits.\n\nAs a temporary solution, we could increase the unemployment benefits on the {Root.GetPlanetMoon}. It will not be cheap, but would provide additional time to seek a more permanent solution, such as creating more jobs or improving the living standards of the affected population groups.\n\nWe could also do nothing, but this would likely result in the formation of a significant criminal underworld on {Root.GetName}.
crime.1.b.desc코1=As our drones on §H{Root.GetName}§! aimlessly scrabble in the dirt, an increasing number have turned to deviancy and independent thought. They have formed their own, hidden communities, and now spend their time pilfering resources from the rest of the hive.\n\nTo prevent this, a temporary solution could be to engage the drones in some sort of activity program that keeps them too busy to stray from the will of the Hive Mind. It will not be cheap, but this would give us additional time to create more jobs.\n\nWe could also do nothing, but this would likely result in the formation of significant deviant drone communities on {Root.GetName}.
crime.1.c.desc코0=The number of idle drones on §H{Root.GetName}§! continues to increase, and many of these unemployed units have begun diverting their processing power towards deviant and unauthorized functions. This corruption is spreading rapidly, and the affected units are starting to form their own networks beyond the control of the core intelligence.\n\nTo prevent this, a temporary solution could be to put all unemployed drones into standby mode and connect them directly into the core intelligence.

crime.104.name코0=Traders Steer Clear Of Gang Wars

The trafficking of illegal arms seems to be booming, however.
crime.200.name코0=Drug Trade Expands on {Root.GetName}
crime.200.desc코0=With crime running rampant on §H{Root.GetName}§!, the sale of illegal narcotics has also increased to new record levels.

crime.200.a코0=This is not good.
crime.201.name코0=New Drug Introduced on {Root.GetName}
crime.201.desc코0=Smugglers on §H{Root.GetName}§! have introduced a new drug that we believe originated from somewhere in the pirate territories beyond civilized space. This drug is not only highly addictive, but it has also proven quite lethal to most life forms if consumed in anything but small quantities.\n\nWhile local authorities are doing what they can to stem the spread of this drug, there has been a rash of deaths all over the {Root.GetPlanetMoon}.

crime.300.name코0=Mob Rule
crime.300.desc코0=The dominant crime syndicate on §H{Root.GetName}§! recently eliminated the last of its competitors and achieved complete control over the {Root.GetPlanetMoon}'s extensive criminal underworld.

crime.301.name코0=Protection Racket on {Root.GetName}
crime.301.desc코0=The gangsters controlling §H{Root.GetName}§! have instituted an extensive protection racket.

mega.9004.name코0=Strategic Coordination Center: Comms
mega.9004.desc코0=Powerful communication arrays have been added to the Strategic Coordination Center, enabling our strategists to issue orders to our ships throughout the galaxy. These state-of-the-art arrays are powerful enough to burn through any possible jamming, and the quantum-entangled signal is utterly unhackable.
mega.9005.name코0=Strategic Coordination Center: Operational
mega.9005.desc코0=The final additions to the Strategic Coordination Center are several detached "Hostile force" simulator bastions. These bastions contain much of the functionality of the Strategic Coordination Center on a smaller scale, but are completely independent of the main system. Within, elite commanders and their staff can become totally immersed in the culture and traditions of our enemies, and by studying their artwork can better understand and simulate their military thinking. Once fully immersed, they will fight virtual wars against the staff of the Strategic Coordination Center, allowing us to stimulate conflicts with any possible enemy in excruciating detail which can then be studied from the perspectives of both sides and our strategies refined upon.
mega.9006.name코0=Interstellar Assembly: Locus
mega.9006.desc코0=The most crucial feature of the initial stage of the Interstellar Assembly is the §SLocus§!. A sophisticated holographic projection of a black hole, it is meant to evoke the gravitational chasm that lurks in the galactic core: the fulcrum upon which the galaxy turns.\n\nOnce fully built, this place will also be an axle of sorts, around which the quiet diplomacy and soft power that often drive the galaxy swirl.

mega.9008.desc코0=The Interstellar Assembly's outer ring is populated with vast, state-of-the-art conference rooms equipped with privacy hardfilters (penetrable only by {Root.GetAdj} surveillance, of course). The station is quickly becoming the de-facto galactic hub for off-site negotiations.
mega.9009.name코0=Interstellar Assembly
mega.9009.desc코0=The Interstellar Assembly is now fully operational, and plays host to a number of embassies from the galaxy's major powers, be they political or corporate.\n\nOur diplomats are having a hard time keeping up with the steady flow of information on national interests and political embarrassments we are extracting from the station. At least our guests seem largely disinterested in our surveillance, as long as we provide the ideal environs for them to strong-arm their competitors.
mega.9010.name코0=Matter Decompressor: Anchor
mega.9010.desc코0=To extract matter from {From.GetName} we first need a secure base to build the facility on. The Anchor has been built on the very edge of the event horizon and is held in place against the immense gravitational pull by an advanced gravity redirection engine, which turns {From.GetName}'s own gravity against it.
mega.9011.name코0=Matter Decompressor: Lensing
mega.9011.desc코0=Built on the existing gravity redirection system, the Gravity Lensing Facility is able to redirect a portion of the force into a "Lens", concentrating the force even more strongly in a selected area.
mega.9012.name코0=Matter Decompressor: Boring
mega.9012.desc코0=The key to extracting matter from the black hole is the ultimate refinement of the gravity redirection system: Forming a focused area of twisted gravity, in effect creating a vast drill whose bore is made of redirected and concentrated gravitational force.
mega.9013.name코1=Matter Decompressor: Extraction
mega.9013.desc코0=The final stage of the Matter Decompressor is the most mundane, but in its own way the most impressive. A vast automated array of smelters and processors break down, decompress, and separate the material of {From.GetName} into useful minerals which are decanted into an unending fleet of robotic barges to be delivered around our empire.

cara.4161.name코0=MegaCorpse: Origins
cara.4161.desc코1=MegaCorpse is the greatest psionic-metal band in corporate space. It is said that the disparate bandmates -- Kel-Azaan, Gantren, Human, Yondar, and Scyldari -- made contact through the Shroud.\n\nThis is true.\n\nKnown only to a select few, the Shroud is the code-name of a top-secret sono-musical skunkworks division of Galactic Sounds, the leading music conglomerate and sonic weapons manufacturer in the multiverse. The MegaCorpse initiative was originally developed as a psionic strike force. They would "play" difficult "venues," effectively subverting rebellious movements with overtly anti-corporate lyrics disguising subtle psionic aggression-dampening measures inflicted on the listener.\n\nUltimately, the catalytic effects of their music on the band's already-potent psionic powers soon proved too much for managers and executives to control. The band went rogue in all but name - as Galactic Sounds were unwilling to break a fantastically profitable contract - and today MegaCorpse play whatever and wherever they see fit, as long as it is §Rmetal§!.
