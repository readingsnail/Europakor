ap_eternal_vigilance코0=Eternal Vigilance
ap_eternal_vigilance_desc코0=To display weakness is to invite attack. The price of invading our space must be so high that as few as possible are prepared to meet it.

ap_grasp_the_void_desc코0=The vast expanse of the galaxy holds limitless riches for those empires that understand how to maintain their grasp on the void.
ap_engineered_evolution_desc코0=To leave our genetic destiny in the hands of nature is an inefficient and excruciatingly slow process. Why not jump-start the future of our species?

ap_the_flesh_is_weak_desc코0=The limits and constraints imposed on us by our feeble organic bodies are simply unacceptable. To reach our full potential, we must turn to cybernetic implants.
ap_synthetic_evolution_desc코0=It is time to abandon the flawed organic vessels that imprison our minds. By transferring our neural patterns into synthetic bodies, we will achieve a higher state of being.
ap_mind_over_matter_desc코0=Only a fraction of the potential contained within our minds has been unlocked. The latent psionic abilities of our species are only now beginning to manifest in certain individuals.

ap_enigmatic_engineering코0=Enigmatic Engineering
ap_enigmatic_engineering_desc코0=Technology is simply not a way to solve a problem, but it is a language by which we ascend beyond the mundane. Lesser minds simply fail to understand our advances.
